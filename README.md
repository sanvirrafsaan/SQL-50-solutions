# SQL-50-solutions
This repository contains solutions to the first 50 LeetCode SQL problems, each implemented in two ways:
- SQL scripts that you can run against your favorite relational database.
- pandas notebooks demonstrating equivalent data-analysis workflows in Python


# Motivation 
Solving LeetCode SQL problems helps strengthen your database querying skills. Translating those queries into pandas deepens your understanding of Python data analysis workflows. This dual-approach repository aims to bridge the gap between SQL-centric and Python-centric data engineers and analysts.
